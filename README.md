# Twitter-analysis-with-pie-chart
The basic idea behind this project is to know how people are reacting to events, celebrities, music, movies, sports whatsoever going around the world. For example, today Neymar (a famous football player) is set to leave his present football club and all I want is to find out how people are reacting to this. Are they happy or sad about this news?. Luckily we have a large database of people from all around the globe where they share their emotions- Twitter!.
